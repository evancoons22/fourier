## fast fourier transform
- Current state: take audio input and transform to frequecy domain, print to terminal. ciruclar buffer, taking window every 0.25 seconds
- this has turned into a digital synth project to generate waveforms

Next: 
1. finish digital synth with midi input and adjustable parameters
2. apply fft to synth waveforms for filters


To use: 
1. `$ make`
2.  `$ ./fft`
