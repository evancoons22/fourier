## fast fourier transform
- initial project  -- audio filters with fast fourier transforms (in fft.c) 
- this has turned into a digital synth project to generate waveforms first

Project path: 
1. finish digital synth with midi input and adjustable parameters
2. run concurrent i/o program to transform sound with dynamic filters (fft, filter, ifft)
3. embedded system? 


How to use synth: 
1. `$ make`
2.  `$ ./synth`



To dos: 
- [X] fix black key highlight.
- [X] new waveform types (sine squared, noise, pulse)
- [ ] add decay for keys so they stop
- [ ] remove sounds after release time is up
- [ ] Larger keyboard in UI
- [ ] key params in UI
